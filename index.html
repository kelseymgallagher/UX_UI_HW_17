        <p>I started my career in tech as a marketing and public relations professional and became curious about how people interacted with apps and products in their daily lives. 

            As a UX designer, researcher, and creative, Iâ€™m passionate about solving real-world problems by turning meaningful conversations into unique and useful products. 
            
            Outside of work, you can find me traveling, hiking, and camping with my dog, Tabor.</p>
